# Documentation

I shall write in this directory documentation, explanations and thoughts on the
implementation.

## Terminology

To make everything simplier to understand, both this documentation and the code
will use the following terminology.

The "Earth" is an habitable planet, and is the most important part of the world
being generated, as most of the actions will happen there.
The "Sun" is the star(s) the Earth is orbiting around. In a multiple star
system, if the Earth is circumbinary, Sun is used to refer to all the stars at
once, else Sun is the star the Earth is orbiting around.
A "Moon" is a natural satellite orbiting around the Earth.
"Humans" is the general name to refer to the primary sentient species living on
Earth.
An "Hour" is an atomic hour and should have the same meaning than in our own
world: that is, one hour is 60 minutes, one minute is 60 seconds and one second
is the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the
transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the
caesium-133 atom at a temperature of 0K. The Hour is the preferred way to
express time.
A "Day" is the shortest time cycle on Earth. It isn't necessarily 24 Hours. It
may be the duration of one rotation of the Earth around its axis, one rotation
of the Earth around the Sun, or one rotation of a Moon around the Earth,
whatever is the shortest. "Month" and "Year" shouldn't be used, as they depend
both on the star system configuration and on the used calendar.
